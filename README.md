**My favorite series**

***Arcane***

> The series is about a two sisters and their friends as they go into the most tragic path of their lives
> The setting is between a highly political and discriminatory place.
> This add to the complexity and depth of the story. 
> The series is full action, and tragic scenarios that can make you sad. 
> The visual sytle and appeal of the series is very unique, making every frame looks like a comic page.
